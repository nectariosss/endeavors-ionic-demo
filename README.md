# Endeavors

## What is an Endeavor?

An endeavor is a concept that represents the intention to achieve something in virtually any domain of the users living experience. It gives the capability of branding any idea under a name/title of choice and because of its structure, it suggests but not enforces an opinionated approach that aims to provide the tools for the idea (which now we called endeavor) to be properly constructed, evolved, evaluated remembered, meditated, rejected, or potentilly executed to success.

## The Endeavor as an object

Below we will describe the properties of the endeavor object, their intentions as well as some suggested writing styles to keep the philosophical foundation of the endeavors system consistent and coherent.

### 1. Attainable

Wether the endavor is physically attainable at the moment of its conception or is just an idea, that for any reason the user wants to make brand it as an endeavor.

### 2. Score

Is an audit mechanism through which the user can give upvotes to endeavors so that they can keep track of their dedication to them. This will have the effect that neglected (especialy active and neglected) endeavors, can get into the attention of the user and take care of them.

### 3. Timeframe

If the nature of the endeavor allows it to have a timeframe, This is the the timeframe in which the user would like the endeavor to begin and be completed.

### 4. Active

Wether an endeavor is actively persued or just stored as abandonded, archived, non-attainable or under-construction idea. Active endeavors are suggested to only be the ones that the user is actively prioritizing in their life.

### 5. Name

The title of the endeavor which is suggested to be brief and UNRELATED with the intention of the endeavor. That means that an endeavor should be titled with a random name, numbers that are remembered and stick out to the user, or creatively generated brand names. This is a mandatory field.

### 6. Abstract

A brief but detailed explanation to what the endeavor is about. the abstract is existent, should inform the user about what the endeavor is about.

### 7. Instant Aim

The trivial target of the endeavor if it has any. The one thing that if it happens, the endeavor will be considered successful in its operations, NOT in its intentions.

### 8. Long Aim

The essential target of the endeavor if it has any. The one thing that if ithappens, the endeavor will be considered successful in its intentions.

### 9. Directives

The guidelines that the user should follow throughout his live while persuing the endeavor. They are never completed and should be followed as general rules.

### 10. Tasks

Tasks are simple operations that the user needs to do to suppor the endeavor and its reason of existence.

### 11. Ideas

Ideas are quick thoughts that might be proven beneficial for the attainment of the endeavor.

### 12. Problems

Problems are obstacles to the attainment of the endeavor that the user is aware of.

### 13. Resources

Resources are links that are relevant to the endeavor.

### 14 .Notes

This is a simple note field so that the user can store quick information there that does not belong to any other field.

###  What is the ambient endeavor?

Ambient endeavors are endeavors that are neither active, nor inactive. Are the endeavors that encapsoulate the users ideals, directives and guidless to various domains and aspects of his life. Most commonly are endeavors which cannot be persued directly, they are not strictly defined, but they are described by a philosophy and an intention towards an end which is not clear whether it came to frutition or is still being persued (like happiness). They can occasionally get assigned tasks etc... but they remain ambient in their nature.

The fact that all of the endeavors properties are optional give rise to virtually unlimited possibilites! See examples to understand how and why.
